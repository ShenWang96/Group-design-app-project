Option 1: Java route (recommended if already in college and have some background in ECE or CS)
1.Go to a simple notepad or download notepad++
2. make sure your machine has downloaded and installed the java sdk (not eclipse)
3. open notepad++ and Save file as: Test.java
4. Know this:
	Your class name MUST correspond to the name of your file
	Everything runs in the main method
	after you are done writing your code in the main method you must compile to a binary		(.class) file and run from the terminal
5. Run your program:
go to terminal/powershell
move into the folder with Test.java (use ls or ls to check current state, cd ____ to go to next)
once you are at the correct location just write javac Test.java (this will create a test.class file)
then to run it java test.java (i think lol) or java test

Option 2: python route (if not in college and/or have never ever coded before. Game mods don't count nor does knowing the command line)
download notepad++
Download python 3 https://www.python.org/downloads/
